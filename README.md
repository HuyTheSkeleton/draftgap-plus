# DraftGap+ (Unofficial Mod)

**DraftGap+** is a modified version of the original **DraftGap** application. It retains all the powerful statistical tools of the original software while introducing new features to provide deeper insight during the drafting phase.

## 🆕 What's New in DraftGap+?

DraftGap+ introduces two major features to make drafting faster and smarter: **Delta Analysis** and **Dynamic Smart Tiers**.

### 1. Dynamic Smart Tiers
Most drafting tools use "static" tier lists (e.g., "Jinx is always S tier this patch"). DraftGap+ is different. **It calculates a custom tier list for every single lobby** based on your specific allies and enemies.

* **Live Calculation:** A champion might be "B Tier" generally, but if they perfectly counter the enemy team and fit your synergy, they will be promoted to **S Tier** instantly.
* **Relative Power:** The tiers aren't fixed. They are ranked relative to the best options available *right now*.
* **The "S+" Badge:** This is a special, rare tier programmed to only appear when a single champion is statistically "miles ahead" of every other option. It signals a "Game Changer" pick that you shouldn't ignore.

### 2. The "Delta" Column
In the original app, suggestions showed the *total* resulting winrate. It was hard to see exactly how much value a specific champion added.

* **What it does:** Calculates the exact difference between your team's *current* winrate and the *projected* winrate with the selected champion.
* **Visual Indicators:**
    * **Positive Delta (+):** Shown in **green**.
    * **Negative Delta (-):** Shown in **red**.
* **Why it helps:** Instantly spot the difference between a "good pick" and a "winning pick" without doing mental math.

## 🛡️ Core Features (Inherited from DraftGap)

DraftGap+ keeps all the excellent features that make the original tool great:

* **Unopinionated Suggestions:** Recommendations are based purely on statistics (meta, matchups, and duos), not subjective opinions.
* **Live Sync:** Integrates directly with the League of Legends client to automatically detect your lobby, roles, and bans.
* **Matchup Analysis:** Suggests champions based on how well they perform against the specific enemies you are facing.
* **Ally Synergy:** Accounts for how well a champion pairs with your existing teammates.
